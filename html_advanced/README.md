# Which guidelines to follow for HTML

When working with HTML, it's important to follow established guidelines and best practices to create well-structured, accessible, and maintainable web pages. Here are some key guidelines to follow:

- Use HTML5: HTML5 is the latest standard, and you should use it as the basis for your web pages.
- Semantic HTML: Use semantic HTML elements to provide meaning and structure to your content. This makes your content more accessible and improves SEO. Common semantic elements include <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer>.
- Proper Nesting: Make sure your HTML elements are properly nested within each other. Opening tags should have corresponding closing tags, and they should not overlap.
- Indentation and Readability: Use consistent and proper indentation to make your code more readable. This helps you and other developers easily understand the structure of your HTML.
- Lowercase Tags and Attributes: Write HTML tags and attributes in lowercase. Although HTML is not case-sensitive, using lowercase is a widely accepted convention and makes your code more consistent.
- Valid HTML: Ensure that your HTML code is valid by validating it with an HTML validator like the one provided by the W3C. Valid HTML is more likely to render correctly in various web browsers.
- Use of Alt Attributes: Always include descriptive alt attributes for images to provide alternative text for screen readers and in case the image cannot be displayed.
- Avoid Deprecated Elements: Do not use deprecated HTML elements, such as <font>, <center>, and `<strike>. Instead, use CSS for styling and alignment.
- Responsive Design: Create web pages that are responsive and adapt to different screen sizes by using CSS media queries and flexible layouts.
- Character Encoding: Specify the character encoding of your document using <meta charset="UTF-8"> in the <head> section to ensure proper text rendering.
- Comments: Use comments in your HTML to provide explanations or notes about specific sections or elements. This is especially helpful for collaboration and debugging.
- Accessibility: Follow web accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) to ensure that your web content is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
- File Organization: Keep your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in separate files and use meaningful file and folder names to maintain a well-organized project structure.
- Minimize Inline Styles: Avoid using inline styles (e.g., style attributes) in your HTML. Instead, use external CSS for styling.
- Optimize Images: Compress and optimize images to reduce page load times. Use appropriate image formats (e.g., JPEG for photos, PNG for transparency, SVG for vector graphics).
- Consistent Naming Conventions: Maintain a consistent and meaningful naming convention for your HTML elements, CSS classes, and JavaScript variables to enhance code maintainability.
- Validate and Test Cross-Browser Compatibility: Test your web pages in multiple web browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility. Use browser developer tools for debugging.

Following these guidelines will help you create clean, well-structured HTML that is accessible, maintainable, and compatible with a wide range of web browsers and devices.

# How to create the skeleton of an HTML5 page

Creating the skeleton of an HTML5 page involves setting up the basic structure of your HTML document. Here's a simple template for creating the skeleton of an HTML5 page:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Your Page Title</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <header>
            <h1>Your Website Title</h1>
            <nav>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#section1">Section 1</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#section2">Section 2</a></li>
                    <!-- Add more navigation links as needed -->
                </ul>
            </nav>
        </header>

        <main>
            <section id="section1">
                <h2>Section 1</h2>
                <p>This is the content of section 1.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="section2">
                <h2>Section 2</h2>
                <p>This is the content of section 2.</p>
            </section>
            <!-- Add more sections and content as needed -->
        </main>

        <footer>
            <p>&copy; 2023 Your Website Name</p>
        </footer>
    </body>
    </html>

Let's break down the components of this HTML5 skeleton:

- <!DOCTYPE html>: This declaration specifies that you are using HTML5.
- <html lang="en">: The opening <html> tag, with a lang attribute set to "en" for English, defines the document's language.
- <head>: This section contains metadata about the document, including character encoding, the viewport settings for responsive design, the page title, and references to external stylesheets and scripts.
- <body>: The main content of your webpage goes inside the <body> element.
- <header>: Typically contains the site's title or logo and the navigation menu.
- <main>: Encloses the primary content of the webpage. It's a good practice to use only one <main> element per page.
- <section>: Divides your content into distinct sections. Each section may have its own heading (<h2> in this example) and content.
- <footer>: Contains information typically found in the footer of a webpage, such as copyright information.

You can customize this template by adding more sections, navigation links, and content as needed for your specific website. Additionally, link your own CSS and JavaScript files and adjust the titles and text to match your content.

# How to use semantic HTML tags to structure a web page

Using semantic HTML tags is essential for structuring a web page in a way that provides meaning and context to both browsers and assistive technologies. Semantic HTML tags make your content more accessible, improve SEO, and help developers understand the purpose of different sections of your page. Here's how to use some common semantic HTML tags to structure a web page:

- <header>: Use the <header> element to define the introductory or top section of your page. This often contains the website's title, logo, and primary navigation.

    <header>
        <h1>Your Website Title</h1>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>

- <nav>: The <nav> element is used to define a section containing navigation links. This is often placed within the <header> but can be used in other contexts as well.

    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>

- <main>: The <main> element encapsulates the primary content of your web page. There should be only one <main> element per page.

    <main>
        <h2>Welcome to Our Website</h2>
        <p>This is the main content of our web page.</p>
    </main>

- <section>: Use the <section> element to group related content together. You can give each section a heading using <h2> or other heading elements.

    <section>
        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Learn more about our company and what we do.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Services</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Service 1</li>
            <li>Service 2</li>
            <li>Service 3</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

- <article>: The <article> element represents a self-contained piece of content that could be distributed and understood independently. It's often used for blog posts, news articles, or product listings.

    <article>
        <h3>Blog Post Title</h3>
        <p>Here's the content of the blog post.</p>
    </article>

- <aside>: The <aside> element is used for content that is related to the surrounding content but can be considered tangential. It's commonly used for sidebars, pull quotes, or advertising.

    <article>
        <h3>Blog Post Title</h3>
        <p>Here's the content of the blog post.</p>
        <aside>
            <p>Related articles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Article 1</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">Article 2</a></li>
            </ul>
        </aside>
    </article>

- <footer>: The <footer> element contains the footer of a section or the entire page. It typically includes copyright information, contact details, or links to related content.

      <footer>
          <p>&copy; 2023 Your Website Name</p>
          <p>Contact us at <a href="/contact">contact@example.com</a></p>
      </footer>

  By using these semantic HTML elements, you provide a clear structure to your web page, making it more accessible and helping search engines understand the content. This results in a better user experience and improved SEO.

# Which use cases to use div vs span

The choice between using <div> and <span> in HTML depends on whether you need to group and style block-level elements or inline elements. Here are the typical use cases for each:

## <div>:

- Block-Level Container: Use <div> when you want to group and style block-level elements, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, or other block-level content. <div> creates a block-level container.

    <div class="container">
        <h1>Heading</h1>
        <p>Paragraph 1</p>
        <p>Paragraph 2</p>
    </div>

- Layout and Structure: <div> is commonly used to structure and layout the content of a web page. It's often used in combination with CSS for creating columns, grids, and other layout elements.

    <div id="sidebar">...</div>
    <div id="main-content">...</div>

- JavaScript Manipulation: When you need to target and manipulate a group of block-level elements using JavaScript, wrapping them in a <div> can be useful.

## <span>:

- Inline Styling: Use <span> to style or target inline elements within a block of text or other inline content. It is often used to apply specific CSS styles or JavaScript functionality to a portion of text.

    <p>This is a <span class="highlighted">highlighted</span> word.</p>

- Text-Level Styling: When you want to apply styles or behavior to specific parts of a text within a larger paragraph, you can use <span>.

    <p>This is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">bold</span> word.</p>

- JavaScript Manipulation: <span> is helpful when you need to target and manipulate specific portions of inline text content using JavaScript.

In summary, <div> is used to group and style block-level elements and is often used for layout and structuring content. <span>, on the other hand, is used for inline elements and is suitable for styling and targeting specific portions of text or inline content. The choice between them depends on your specific use case and the nature of the elements you want to work with.

# The semantic value’s of header, main, footer, article, nav, section, aside

Semantic HTML elements, including <header>, <main>, <footer>, <article>, <nav>, <section>, and <aside>, have distinct semantic meanings that convey the purpose and structure of content. Here's a brief overview of the semantic values of these elements:

- <header>: The <header> element represents the introductory content or a set of navigational links for its parent section or the whole page. It typically contains the site's title, logo, and primary navigation menus.
- <main>: The <main> element encapsulates the primary content of the document. It should be unique to the document and not nested within other semantic sections. It helps assistive technologies and search engines understand the main content of the page.
- <footer>: The <footer> element represents the footer of its nearest ancestor section or the entire page. It often contains information such as copyright notices, contact details, related links, and other metadata.
- <article>: The <article> element defines a self-contained piece of content that can be distributed or syndicated independently. It is suitable for content like blog posts, news articles, product listings, and forum posts.
- <nav>: The <nav> element is used to mark a section that contains navigation links. It is typically found in the <header> but can also be used elsewhere to define a set of navigation links within its parent section.
- <section>: The <section> element groups related content together and provides a thematic grouping. It is used to structure content within a document. Each <section> can have its own heading and should make sense when read on its own.
- <aside>: The <aside> element represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it. It is often used for sidebars, pull quotes, advertisements, or content that can be considered "extra" or supplementary.

These semantic elements enhance the accessibility, SEO, and overall structure of your web pages. When used correctly, they provide a clear and meaningful representation of your content, making it easier for both users and search engines to understand the purpose and hierarchy of different sections on your webpage.

# How to use headings (and why it’s important to follow the hierarchical order)

Using headings in HTML is crucial for structuring your content and making it more accessible to both users and search engines. Headings not only provide visual cues about the organization of your content but also help assistive technologies understand the document's hierarchy. Here's how to use headings effectively and why it's important to follow a hierarchical order:

How to Use Headings:

- Use <h1> to <h6>: HTML provides six levels of headings, from <h1> (the highest level) to <h6> (the lowest level). Use these tags to create headings in your content.

    <h1>Main Heading</h1>
    <h2>Subheading 1</h2>
    <h3>Sub-subheading 1.1</h3>
    <h2>Subheading 2</h2>

- Use Descriptive Text: Make sure your headings provide a concise and meaningful description of the content they introduce. Avoid generic headings like "Untitled" or "Page 1."
- Nesting: You can nest headings within one another to create a hierarchical structure that represents the relationship between different sections of your content.

    <h1>Main Heading</h1>
    <p>Some content here.</p>
    <h2>Subheading 1</h2>
    <p>More content.</p>
    <h3>Sub-subheading 1.1</h3>
    <p>Even more content.</p>
    <h2>Subheading 2</h2>
    <p>Additional content.</p>

Why It's Important to Follow the Hierarchical Order:

- Accessibility: Screen readers and other assistive technologies rely on the hierarchical structure of headings to help users with visual impairments navigate and understand the content. Following the correct order ensures that the content is presented in a logical and meaningful way.
- SEO: Search engines use headings to understand the content and hierarchy of your web page. Properly structured headings can improve your search engine ranking and help users find relevant information in search results.
- Readability: Headings make your content more readable and scannable for all users. Users can quickly identify sections and topics within your content, making it easier to find what they are looking for.
- Consistency: Following a hierarchical order ensures consistency and clarity in your content structure. It makes your content more organized and easier to maintain.
- Content Organization: Headings provide an outline of your content, allowing you to plan and organize your thoughts and ideas. They help you create a logical flow of information.

In summary, using headings and following a hierarchical order in your HTML documents is essential for accessibility, SEO, readability, consistency, and content organization. It enhances the user experience and makes your content more accessible and meaningful to a wider audience.

How to make lists in HTML

In HTML, you can create both ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists. Here's how to make lists in HTML:

Ordered List (<ol>):
An ordered list is used to create a list of items with a numerical or alphabetical order.

    <ol>
        <li>First item</li>
        <li>Second item</li>
        <li>Third item</li>
    </ol>

Unordered List (<ul>):
An unordered list is used to create a list of items with bullet points.

    <ul>
        <li>Red</li>
        <li>Green</li>
        <li>Blue</li>
    </ul>

Description List (<dl>):
A description list is used when you want to create a list of terms and their descriptions.

    <dl>
        <dt>HTML</dt>
        <dd>HyperText Markup Language</dd>
        <dt>CSS</dt>
        <dd>Cascading Style Sheets</dd>
    </dl>

In each type of list, you use the <li> (list item) element to define individual list items. For ordered lists, the numbering is automatically generated, and for unordered lists, bullet points are used.

You can also style lists using CSS to change the appearance of the bullets or numbers and adjust the spacing between list items.

Here's an example of how you can apply CSS to an unordered list to style the list items and remove default bullets:

    <style>
        ul {
            list-style: none; /* Remove default bullets */
        }

        li {
            margin: 5px 0; /* Adjust spacing between list items */
            padding-left: 20px; /* Add custom bullet point or marker */
            background: url('bullet.png') no-repeat 0 50%;
        }
    </style>

    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
    </ul>

You can customize the styling of your lists further by adjusting CSS properties such as list-style-type, list-style-image, and margin. These styles help you create lists that match your webpage's design and layout.

# The differences between medias (SVG, GIF, PNG, JPG)

SVG, GIF, PNG, and JPG are different image formats, each with its own characteristics and best use cases. Here are the key differences between them:

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):

- SVG is a vector graphics format, which means images are created using mathematical equations to define shapes and lines, rather than pixels.
- It is resolution-independent, meaning it can be scaled without loss of quality, making it ideal for logos, icons, and simple illustrations.
- SVG images are XML-based, and their code can be directly embedded in HTML.
- Suitable for graphics that need to look crisp at various sizes and for animations.

GIF (Graphics Interchange Format):

- GIF is a raster graphics format that supports both static and animated images.
- It uses lossless compression, making it suitable for images with large areas of solid colors or simple graphics.
- GIFs are limited to 256 colors, which may result in reduced quality for images with many colors.
- Often used for simple animations, icons, and images with transparency.

PNG (Portable Network Graphics):

- PNG is a raster format that supports lossless compression, preserving image quality.
- It is capable of displaying millions of colors and provides transparency support, making it suitable for images with detailed graphics, transparency, and crisp edges.
- PNGs come in two main types: PNG-8 (256 colors, similar to GIF) and PNG-24 (full color range with larger file sizes).
- Ideal for images with transparency, web graphics, and screenshots.

JPG (Joint Photographic Experts Group):

- JPG is a raster format designed for photographs and complex images.
- It uses lossy compression, which can result in image quality degradation with each compression.
- JPG supports millions of colors and is efficient for photographs with varying color gradients.
- Not suitable for images with sharp edges, text, or transparency, as it may lead to artifacts.

In summary, the choice of image format depends on the specific use case:

- Use SVG for vector graphics and scalable images, such as logos and icons.
- Use GIF for simple animations and images with transparency.
- Use PNG for images with transparency and detailed graphics.
- Use JPG for photographs and images with continuous color gradients.

# How to structure data in a table

To structure data in an HTML table, you'll use a combination of table-related elements to define the table structure, rows, columns, and data. Here's how to create a basic table structure:

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Header 1</th>
                <th>Header 2</th>
                <th>Header 3</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Data 1</td>
                <td>Data 2</td>
                <td>Data 3</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Data 4</td>
                <td>Data 5</td>
                <td>Data 6</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

Let's break down the structure of a table:

- <table>: The main table element is used to create the table itself.
- <thead>: The table head section contains the table headers, typically used to label columns. You can use the <th> (table header) element to define header cells.
- <tr>: A table row. The <tr> element is used to group table cells together in a row.
- <th>: Table header cells are used to label columns. They are typically bold and centered by default.
- <tbody>: The table body section contains the actual data rows. You can use the <td> (table data) element to define data cells.
- <td>: Table data cells are used to display data in the table. They are usually plain text.

You can add more rows and columns as needed, and you can also include additional table sections, such as <tfoot> (table footer) if necessary.

Here's an example with additional sections and more data:

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Age</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>John Doe</td>
                <td>30</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Jane Smith</td>
                <td>28</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
        <tfoot>
            <tr>
                <td>Total</td>
                <td>58</td>
            </tr>
        </tfoot>
    </table>

Tables are a powerful way to organize and present structured data on a web page. You can further style and format tables using CSS to make them visually appealing and match your website's design.

# How to integrate a video in a webpage

To integrate a video into a webpage, you can use the HTML <video> element. Here's how to do it:

- Prepare your video file: Make sure you have a video file in a supported format, such as MP4, WebM, or Ogg. You should also have different versions of the video in these formats to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
- Place the video file in your project directory: Upload the video files to your web server or place them in the same directory as your HTML file.
- Use the <video> element: Add the <video> element to your HTML document where you want the video to appear. Include the necessary attributes to specify the video source(s) and provide fallback content for browsers that don't support video.

Here's a basic example:

    <video controls>
    <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="video.webm" type="video/webm">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>

In this example:

- <video>: This is the video container.
- controls: This attribute adds playback controls (play, pause, volume, etc.) to the video.
- <source>: Each <source> element specifies a video file in a different format and includes the type attribute to indicate the format. Browsers will use the first supported format they encounter.

The text "Your browser does not support the video tag." is displayed in browsers that don't support the <video> element.

You can also add additional attributes to the <video> element for customization:

- width and height: Specify the dimensions of the video.
- poster: Set a poster image to display as a placeholder before the video plays.
- autoplay: Start playing the video automatically.
- loop: Make the video loop continuously.
- preload: Indicate how the browser should preload the video (e.g., auto, metadata, none).

Here's an example with some additional attributes:

    <video controls width="640" height="360" poster="video-poster.jpg" autoplay loop preload="auto">
        <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        <source src="video.webm" type="video/webm">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>

Make sure to provide accessible fallback content for users whose browsers do not support HTML5 video, and consider adding captions or subtitles for accessibility if your video contains spoken content.

# How to integrate an audio file in a webpage

To integrate an audio file into a webpage, you can use the HTML5 <audio> element. Here's how to do it:

- Prepare your audio file: Ensure you have an audio file in a supported format, such as MP3, Ogg, or WAV. You may want to provide multiple formats for better cross-browser compatibility.
- Place the audio files in your project directory: Upload the audio files to your web server or place them in the same directory as your HTML file.
- Use the <audio> element: Add the <audio> element to your HTML document where you want the audio to appear. Include the necessary attributes to specify the audio source(s) and provide fallback content for browsers that don't support audio.

Here's a basic example:

    <audio controls>
        <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
        Your browser does not support the audio tag.
    </audio>

In this example:

- <audio>: This is the audio container.
- controls: This attribute adds playback controls (play, pause, volume, etc.) to the audio player.
- <source>: Each <source> element specifies an audio file in a different format and includes the type attribute to indicate the format. Browsers will use the first supported format they encounter.

The text "Your browser does not support the audio tag." is displayed in browsers that don't support the <audio> element.

You can also add additional attributes to the <audio> element for customization:

- autoplay: Start playing the audio automatically.
- loop: Make the audio loop continuously.
- preload: Indicate how the browser should preload the audio (e.g., auto, metadata, none).

Here's an example with some additional attributes:

    <audio controls autoplay loop preload="auto">
        <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
        Your browser does not support the audio tag.
    </audio>

Make sure to provide accessible fallback content for users whose browsers do not support HTML5 audio, and consider adding captions or subtitles for accessibility if your audio contains spoken content.

# How to embed external content

You can embed external content, such as videos, audio, social media posts, and other web elements, into your web page using various HTML elements and embedding techniques. Here are some common methods for embedding external content:

## Embedding Videos (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.):

To embed videos from platforms like YouTube or Vimeo, you can use an <iframe> element with the video's embed code provided by the platform. For example, to embed a YouTube video, you might use code like this:

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Replace "VIDEO_ID" with the actual video's unique identifier.

## Embedding Audio (SoundCloud, Spotify, etc.):

Similar to embedding videos, you can embed audio tracks from platforms like SoundCloud or Spotify using <iframe> elements. You'll need to use the provided embed code from the platform.

## Embedding Maps (Google Maps):

To embed Google Maps, you can use an <iframe> with the map's embed code. Customize the map's size, location, and other settings as needed.

    <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?params"></iframe>

## Embedding Social Media Posts:

Most social media platforms provide embed codes for individual posts or timelines. You can use <iframe> or JavaScript code to embed these posts into your web page.

For Twitter:

    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
        <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterUser/status/TWEET_ID"></a>
    </blockquote>
    <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Embedding External Widgets:

Many external services offer widgets for specific purposes, like newsletter sign-up forms or weather widgets. You can embed these widgets using provided code.

## Embedding Documents (PDFs, Google Docs):

To embed documents, you can use <iframe> or <object> elements. For PDFs, you can use Google's PDF viewer by specifying the URL of the PDF document.

    <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/gview?url=YOUR_PDF_URL&embedded=true"></iframe>

## Embedding External Content via JavaScript:

Some external content may be embedded using JavaScript. For example, you can use JavaScript libraries like "oEmbed" to automatically embed content from supported websites.

    <div class="oembed" data-url="https://example.com"></div>
    <script src="oembed.js"></script>

The "oEmbed" script would handle the embedding of the content based on the URL provided.

When embedding external content, be mindful of the terms of use and policies of the service you're embedding from, especially regarding copyright and usage restrictions. Additionally, consider responsive design to ensure that the embedded content adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

# How to correctly structure an HTML page

To correctly structure an HTML page, follow best practices for creating a well-organized, semantically meaningful, and accessible document. Here is a basic structure for an HTML page:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Your Page Title</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <header>
            <h1>Your Website Title</h1>
            <nav>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
                </ul>
            </nav>
        </header>

        <main>
            <section>
                <h2>Section 1</h2>
                <p>This is the content of section 1.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Section 2</h2>
                <p>This is the content of section 2.</p>
            </section>
        </main>

        <footer>
            <p>&copy; 2023 Your Website Name</p>
        </footer>
    </body>
    </html>

Here's an explanation of each part of the structure:

- <!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document as an HTML5 document.
- <html lang="en">: The root element of the document. The lang attribute is set to "en" for English.
- <head>: Contains metadata and links to external resources. It includes the character set, viewport settings, title, and links to CSS stylesheets.
- <meta charset="UTF-8">: Specifies the character encoding as UTF-8 for proper text rendering.
- <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: Sets the viewport settings for responsive design.
- <title>: Defines the page title that appears in the browser's title bar or tab.
- <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">: Links an external CSS file for styling the page.
- <body>: Contains the main content of the webpage.
- <header>: Typically contains the site title or logo, along with primary navigation links.
- <nav>: Defines a navigation section, which contains links to various parts of the website.
- <main>: Encloses the primary content of the webpage. There should be only one <main> element per page.
- <section>: Divides the content into distinct sections, each with a heading (<h2> in this example) and related content.
- <footer>: Contains information typically found in the footer of a webpage, such as copyright notices or contact details.

By following this structure and incorporating semantic HTML elements, you make your web page more accessible, SEO-friendly, and maintainable. Customize the content and styles as needed for your specific website.
